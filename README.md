# Project-React-Stefanini

The application will initially display a list of publications sorted by date in descending order.
Each publication must have a title, a description and a date. In turn, publications will be
associated to an author, who will have a first name, last name and email address. The authorâ€™s
information must be displayed as part of the publication.
The list of publications must be paginated, limiting the number of entries to a maximum of 10 at
a time.
The user should be able to invert the order of publications showing the oldest ones first.
All the authors should be listed in a sidebar, and the user should be able to click on one of them
to see a list of their publications.
